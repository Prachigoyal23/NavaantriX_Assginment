The CRUD_OPERATION.py, implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a sales dataset stored in a CSV file using Python's pandas library. The dataset, named sales_data_sample.csv, contains columns such as ORDERNUMBER, QUANTITYORDERED, PRICEEACH, SALES, ORDERDATE, STATUS, and CUSTOMERNAME, among others, providing detailed information about orders. The core functions include load_data() for loading the dataset, create_record(new_record) for adding new entries, read_records(filter_conditions=None) for retrieving and displaying data with optional filtering, update_record(index, updated_data) for modifying existing records, and delete_record(index) for removing records.

This Analysis.py contains a Python application built using Plotly Dash for interactive visualization of a sales dataset. The dashboard enables users to perform both descriptive and predictive analysis, offering an engaging way to explore various aspects of the sales data. Key features include an interactive dashboard that allows filtering by product line, with three types of visualizations: a bar chart displaying total sales by product line, a line chart illustrating sales trends over time, and a pie chart showing the distribution of order statuses. 

This Web_Scraping.py is designed to scrape product data from the Flipkart website, specifically targeting mobile phones. Utilizing the requests library to handle HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, the script iterates through multiple search result pages (from page 2 to page 11) to extract essential product information. The collected data includes brand names, prices, ratings, rating counts, and product URLs. After gathering this information, it compiles the data into a pandas DataFrame and saves it as an Excel file, facilitating easy access and analysis of the mobile phone listings. This script is a useful tool for anyone looking to compare mobile options within a specific price range efficiently.
